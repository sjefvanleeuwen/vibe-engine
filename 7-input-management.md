# 7. Input Management

This document details the approach for the Input Management module.

## Overview

The Input Management module handles user input from various sources (keyboard, mouse, touch) and provides a unified interface for input detection and event handling.

## Approach

1. Create an InputManager class to centralize input handling.
2. Implement device-specific adapters for different input types.
3. Provide an input mapping system for configurable controls.
4. Design an event system for propagating input events.

## Implementation Steps

- Set up event listeners for standard DOM events (keydown, keyup, mousedown, etc.).
- Create abstractions for input states (pressed, released, held).
- Implement input mapping to convert raw input to game actions.
- Design a polling API for immediate state checks.
- Add support for gamepad/controller input.

## Considerations

- Handle cross-browser compatibility issues.
- Allow for dynamic rebinding of controls.
- Consider touch/mobile input requirements.
- Implement input buffering for timing-sensitive actions.
- Design with accessibility in mind.
- Optimize event handling to prevent performance issues.

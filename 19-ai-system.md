# 19. AI System

This document details the approach for the AI System module.

## Overview

The AI System provides tools for creating intelligent behaviors, including pathfinding, decision making, and environment perception.

## Approach

1. Create an AIManager to coordinate AI systems.
2. Implement pathfinding for navigation.
3. Design behavior tree system for decision making.
4. Add perception systems for world awareness.

## Implementation Steps

- Implement A* or other pathfinding algorithms.
- Create a navigation mesh system for terrain traversal.
- Design a behavior tree implementation for complex decisions.
- Add sensory systems (sight, hearing) for AI perception.
- Implement goal-oriented action planning as an alternative to behavior trees.

## Considerations

- Balance between realistic behavior and performance.
- Design for multi-threading to handle multiple AI agents.
- Create debugging visualizations for AI behavior.
- Support different levels of AI complexity based on distance or importance.
- Consider coordination between multiple AI agents.
- Design an intuitive API for gameplay programmers.

# 4. Resource Management

This document provides a detailed approach for Resource Management.

## Overview

The ResourceManager module handles the asynchronous loading, caching, and retrieval of assets such as shaders, textures, and models.

## Approach

1. Create a ResourceManager class that stores asset references.
2. Utilize promises or async/await for loading resources.
3. Implement caching to prevent duplicate loads.
4. Provide a unified API for resource queries.

## Implementation Steps

- Implement loadShader(), loadTexture(), and loadModel() methods.
- Use fetch() and modern JavaScript APIs to load assets asynchronously.
- Check if assets exist in cache before loading.
- Optionally add versioning or update logic for reloading changes.
- Maintain clear separation between resource loading and rendering/data usage.

## Considerations

- Account for error handling and fallback loading.
- Optimize caching to reduce network overhead.
- Consider memory management and cleanup of unused resources.
- Provide detailed logging for debugging resource loading issues.

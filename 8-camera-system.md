# 8. Camera System

This document details the approach for the Camera System module.

## Overview

The Camera System provides different camera types, controls for camera movement, and view/projection calculations for the rendering pipeline.

## Approach

1. Design a base Camera class with common functionality.
2. Implement specialized camera types (PerspectiveCamera, OrthographicCamera).
3. Create camera controllers for different movement styles.
4. Add frustum culling capabilities to optimize rendering.

## Implementation Steps

- Create the Camera base class with position, rotation, and basic view matrix calculation.
- Implement PerspectiveCamera with field of view, aspect ratio, near/far planes.
- Build OrthographicCamera with size, near/far planes.
- Add camera controllers (orbit, first-person, follow) as separate classes.
- Implement frustum culling to skip rendering objects outside the view.

## Considerations

- Ensure smooth camera transitions and interpolation.
- Implement efficient matrix updates only when camera properties change.
- Account for special camera effects like shake or zoom.
- Consider VR/AR specific camera requirements.
- Avoid gimbal lock issues with proper rotation handling.
- Design an API that's intuitive for developers to use.

## Separation of Concerns

Each module is designed to focus on a specific part of the engine. Modules interact through well-defined interfaces to reduce coupling:

1. Engine: Serves as the entry point and coordinates subsystems.
2. Renderer: Isolates rendering logic and WebGPU-specific code.
3. Scene: Encapsulates scene graph management and entity lifecycle.
4. ResourceManager: Decouples asset loading from other systems.
5. Components: Allow entity functionality extension without modification.
6. Math: Provides utility functions without dependencies on engine state.
7. Input: Encapsulates platform-specific input detection and mapping.
8. Camera: Handles view transformation independently from scene graph.
9. Time: Tracks timing information used by other modules.
10. Debug: Provides tools without affecting production functionality.
11. Audio: Manages sounds without interfering with rendering or gameplay.
12. UI: Handles 2D elements separately from 3D scene objects.
13. Physics: Simulates physical interactions independently from rendering.
14. Animation: Handles character and object animations separately from rendering.
15. Particles: Manages effect systems independently from standard rendering.
16. Networking: Isolates multiplayer concerns from game logic.
17. Scripting: Allows gameplay logic to be developed separately from engine code.
18. Serialization: Handles data persistence without coupling to specific systems.
19. AI: Encapsulates intelligent behavior separate from entity management.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the base classes using ES6 class syntax.
2. Incrementally develop each module ensuring clear separation and unit testing.
3. Integrate with WebGPU APIs for rendering and performance.
4. Create examples that demonstrate the functionality of each subsystem.

This structure will guide the development of a modular and maintainable 3D game engine.

# 15. Particle System

This document details the approach for the Particle System module.

## Overview

The Particle System handles the creation, simulation, and rendering of particle effects such as fire, smoke, water, and other visual effects.

## Approach

1. Create a ParticleSystem class for managing particle effects.
2. Implement ParticleEmitter for controlling particle creation.
3. Design GPU-based simulation for performance.
4. Support various emission shapes and behaviors.

## Implementation Steps

- Design data-oriented particle structures for efficient GPU processing.
- Implement compute shader-based particle simulation.
- Create emission patterns (point, line, sphere, etc.) for different effect types.
- Add particle behaviors (attraction, repulsion, turbulence).
- Develop rendering techniques for different particle types.

## Considerations

- Focus on GPU-acceleration to handle thousands of particles.
- Design a flexible parameter system for artists to control effects.
- Implement LOD system for particle effects based on distance.
- Support interaction with physics for realistic effects.
- Consider memory pooling to avoid runtime allocations.
- Add support for particle collision with scene geometry.

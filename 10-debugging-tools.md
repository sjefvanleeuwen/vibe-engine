# 10. Debugging Tools

This document details the approach for the Debugging Tools module.

## Overview

The Debugging Tools module provides utilities for performance monitoring, visual debugging, and error reporting to assist developers during development.

## Approach

1. Create a DebugManager class for central management of debugging features.
2. Implement performance metrics collection and display.
3. Add visual debugging tools for scene elements.
4. Provide comprehensive error reporting and logging.

## Implementation Steps

- Design a performance monitor to track FPS, memory usage, and render stats.
- Implement visual debug rendering for bounding boxes, normals, and collision shapes.
- Create a logging system with different severity levels.
- Add a debug UI for runtime property inspection and modification.
- Implement console commands for debugging actions.

## Considerations

- Make debugging features easily toggleable.
- Ensure minimal performance impact when debug features are disabled.
- Consider integration with browser developer tools.
- Implement conditional compilation or build flags to strip debug code from production.
- Design the system to be helpful without overwhelming the user with information.

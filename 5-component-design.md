# 5. Component Based Design (Optional)

This document elaborates on the optional approach for Component Based Design.

## Overview

This module focuses on extending entities using components to enable flexible behaviors such as physics, audio, or additional visual features.

## Approach

1. Define a base Component class from which all other components inherit.
2. Allow entities to attach or detach components dynamically.
3. Create specialized components (e.g., TransformComponent, MeshComponent, AudioComponent).
4. Structure components to be notified of scene updates or events.

## Implementation Steps

- Design a Component class with common lifecycle methods such as init() and update().
- Establish a communication interface between the Entity and its attached components.
- Create reusable components that encapsulate specific behaviors.
- Ensure the component system supports dependency injection or event propagation.
- Add mechanisms for component serialization if saving state is required.

## Considerations

- Keep the core Entity class lightweight by offloading behavior to components.
- Guarantee that components do not directly interfere with each other.
- Document clear interfaces for extending new behavior via components.
- Plan for potential performance impacts from dynamic attachment/detachment.

# 9. Time Management

This document details the approach for the Time Management module.

## Overview

The Time Management module handles timing information, delta time calculations, and fixed timestep logic for consistent updates and animations.

## Approach

1. Create a TimeManager class to track time-related information.
2. Implement delta time calculation between frames.
3. Add fixed timestep functionality for physics or deterministic updates.
4. Provide utilities for animation timing and scheduling.

## Implementation Steps

- Initialize time tracking at engine start.
- Calculate delta time between consecutive frames.
- Implement accumulator-based fixed timestep system.
- Add support for time scaling (slow-motion, fast-forward).
- Create scheduling functions for delayed or periodic execution.

## Considerations

- Handle edge cases like browser tab switching or long frame times.
- Ensure consistent behavior across different devices and frame rates.
- Consider high precision timing when available.
- Implement frame limiting options to prevent excessive CPU/GPU usage.
- Document best practices for using delta time in movement calculations.

# 16. Networking

This document details the approach for the Networking module.

## Overview

The Networking module enables multiplayer functionality through client-server communication, state synchronization, and network optimization.

## Approach

1. Create a NetworkManager class for handling connection and communication.
2. Implement client and server connection handlers.
3. Design a replication system for state synchronization.
4. Add prediction and reconciliation for smooth gameplay.

## Implementation Steps

- Implement WebSocket or WebRTC communication.
- Create serialization for network messages.
- Develop authority model (server authoritative or peer-to-peer).
- Add delta compression for bandwidth optimization.
- Implement client-side prediction and server reconciliation.

## Considerations

- Design for various network conditions (latency, packet loss).
- Implement security measures to prevent cheating.
- Add support for different network topologies.
- Consider fallbacks for connection loss.
- Design API that abstracts network complexity from gameplay code.
- Implement bandwidth optimization techniques.

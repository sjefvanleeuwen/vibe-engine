# 11. Audio System

This document details the approach for the Audio System module.

## Overview

The Audio System handles sound loading, playback, spatial audio effects, and mixing to provide auditory feedback in the game environment.

## Approach

1. Create an AudioManager class for central sound management.
2. Implement sound loading and caching for efficient resource usage.
3. Add spatial audio capabilities for 3D sound positioning.
4. Provide audio mixing and effects processing.

## Implementation Steps

- Integrate with Web Audio API for high-quality audio playback.
- Create methods for loading audio files (loadSound, playSound).
- Implement 3D audio positioning based on listener and sound source locations.
- Add support for volume control, muting, and audio effects.
- Create a sound group system for organized audio mixing.

## Considerations

- Handle browser autoplay restrictions and user interaction requirements.
- Implement streaming for longer audio files.
- Consider memory usage for audio resources.
- Add fallbacks for unsupported audio features.
- Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
- Respect user preferences for audio accessibility.

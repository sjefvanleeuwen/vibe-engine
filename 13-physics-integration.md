# 13. Physics Integration

This document details the approach for the Physics Integration module.

## Overview

The Physics Integration module provides realistic physical interactions between entities, including collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and physics world simulation.

## Approach

1. Create a PhysicsWorld class to manage the physics simulation.
2. Implement RigidBody and Collider components for entities.
3. Design collision detection and response systems.
4. Integrate physics simulation with the entity-component system.

## Implementation Steps

- Create physics body and collider primitives (box, sphere, capsule).
- Implement broad-phase and narrow-phase collision detection.
- Add rigid body dynamics with properties like mass, friction, restitution.
- Create constraints for joints and connections between bodies.
- Design integration with the scene graph and entity transforms.

## Considerations

- Balance between physical accuracy and performance.
- Implement fixed timestep updates for stable simulation.
- Design for deterministic physics when required.
- Consider integration with existing physics libraries.
- Allow for non-physical objects to interact with the physics world.
- Plan for debugging and visualization of physics objects and collisions.

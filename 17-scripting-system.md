# 17. Scripting System

This document details the approach for the Scripting System module.

## Overview

The Scripting System provides a way to write gameplay logic without modifying engine code, enabling rapid iteration and extensibility.

## Approach

1. Create a ScriptManager class to load and execute scripts.
2. Expose engine API to the scripting environment.
3. Implement script lifecycle hooks.
4. Ensure safe execution and error handling.

## Implementation Steps

- Integrate JavaScript engine (native browser JS or specialized like V8).
- Create a script component for attaching scripts to entities.
- Design an API bridge between engine and script environment.
- Implement script hot-reloading for faster development.
- Add sandboxing for script security.

## Considerations

- Balance between performance and flexibility.
- Design clear API boundaries for script access.
- Implement debugging tools for scripts.
- Consider TypeScript support for better developer experience.
- Plan for asynchronous script execution.
- Document thoroughly to assist developers.

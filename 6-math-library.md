# 6. Math Library

This document details the approach for the Math Library module.

## Overview

The Math Library provides essential mathematical operations for 3D graphics, including vector and matrix operations, quaternions, and utility functions.

## Approach

1. Implement vector classes (Vector2, Vector3, Vector4) with common operations.
2. Create matrix classes (Matrix3, Matrix4) with transformation functions.
3. Develop quaternion class for smooth rotations.
4. Add utility functions for common 3D operations.

## Implementation Steps

- Design immutable vector and matrix classes for predictable behavior.
- Implement standard operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, dot/cross products.
- Create transformation functions (translate, rotate, scale) for matrices.
- Build quaternion operations including slerp for smooth interpolation.
- Add utility methods for converting between different representations.

## Considerations

- Optimize for performance by avoiding unnecessary object creation.
- Use static methods where appropriate to reduce garbage collection.
- Consider using TypedArrays for better performance with WebGPU.
- Implement proper documentation with examples for each method.
- Create unit tests to verify mathematical correctness.

# 3. Scene Management

This document details the approach for Scene Management.

## Overview

The Scene Management module is tasked with organizing game objects, managing hierarchical relationships, and updating transforms.

## Approach

1. Define a Scene class that manages a collection of entities.
2. Implement an Entity class to represent individual objects in the scene.
3. Construct a scene graph that supports parent-child relationships.
4. Implement update routines for transforms, physics, or behaviors.
5. Facilitate addition and removal of entities dynamically.

## Implementation Steps

- Design the Scene class with methods such as addEntity() and removeEntity().
- Create an Entity class with properties for position, rotation, and scale.
- Use a recursive algorithm to update transform for the entire scene graph.
- Consider spatial partitioning for performance enhancement.
- Abstract entity components for future extensibility.

## Considerations

- Ensure scene updates are efficient to support real-time changes.
- Document relationships between parent and child entities.
- Keep transformation math separate from scene management.
- Plan for potential integration with physics or collision systems.

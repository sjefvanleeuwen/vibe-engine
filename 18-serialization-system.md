# 18. Serialization System

This document details the approach for the Serialization System module.

## Overview

The Serialization System handles saving and loading game state, including scene configurations, entity properties, and persistent game data.

## Approach

1. Create a SerializationManager to coordinate serialization operations.
2. Design serializers for different data types.
3. Implement versioning for backward compatibility.
4. Support different storage backends.

## Implementation Steps

- Define serialization formats (JSON, binary, or both).
- Implement serialization for entity-component structures.
- Create versioning system for handling older save files.
- Support partial serialization for saving specific subsystems.
- Add compression options for large save files.

## Considerations

- Balance between human-readable formats and efficiency.
- Plan for schema evolution as the game changes.
- Design for cross-platform file compatibility.
- Consider encryption for sensitive save data.
- Implement async serialization for large worlds.
- Support serializing references between objects.

# 14. Animation System

This document details the approach for the Animation System module.

## Overview

The Animation System provides a framework for skeletal animations, keyframe-based animations, and blending between different animation states.

## Approach

1. Create an AnimationSystem class to manage all animations.
2. Implement Animator component for entities requiring animation.
3. Design AnimationClip class to store animation data.
4. Develop skinning system for skeletal animation.

## Implementation Steps

- Design data structures for skeletal hierarchies and skinning.
- Implement keyframe interpolation for smooth animation.
- Create a state machine for animation transitions.
- Develop animation blending for smooth transitions between clips.
- Add support for animation events to trigger game logic at specific frames.

## Considerations

- Optimize skinning calculations with GPU-based skinning where possible.
- Support animation compression to reduce memory footprint.
- Design a flexible system for procedural animation.
- Consider runtime retargeting of animations between different skeletal structures.
- Support morph target animation for facial expressions or shape deformation.
- Implement inverse kinematics for dynamic limb positioning.

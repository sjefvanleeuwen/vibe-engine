# 1. Engine Initialization

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Implemented**: The Engine class is now functional and handles:
- WebGPU adapter and device initialization
- Canvas configuration
- Main game loop with delta time
- Resize handling with proper device pixel ratio
- Renderer initialization and management

## Overview

The Engine module is responsible for setting up the WebGPU adapter and device, configuring the rendering canvas, and managing the main loop.

## Current Implementation

The `Engine` class implements:

1. `constructor(canvas)` - Sets up the engine with a canvas reference
2. `async start()` - Initializes WebGPU and starts the render loop
3. `handleResize()` - Handles canvas resizing with device pixel ratio
4. `loop(currentTime)` - Main loop with delta time calculation
5. `update(deltaTime)` and `render()` - Game state update and rendering

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Get the canvas element
const canvas = document.getElementById('vibeCanvas');

// Create and start the engine
const engine = new Engine(canvas);
await engine.start();
```

## Next Steps

- Add support for scene management
- Implement entity-component system
- Add input handling capabilities
- Create a debug UI overlay

## Implementation Steps

- Use navigator.gpu.requestAdapter() to get the adapter.
- Use adapter.requestDevice() to obtain the GPU device.
- Initialize the canvas element with GPU configuration.
- Setup error handling and fallback if WebGPU is unsupported.
- Define a loop (using requestAnimationFrame) that updates the engine and triggers rendering.

## Considerations

- Modularize initialization logic in an Engine class.
- Keep error handling isolated and informative.
- Document each API call with inline comments.
- Maintain separation between initialization and rendering logic.

# 1. Engine Initialization

This document details the approach for the Engine Initialization module.

## Overview

The Engine module is responsible for setting up the WebGPU adapter and device, configuring the rendering canvas, and managing the main loop.

## Approach

1. Identify and select a WebGPU adapter.
2. Request a device from the adapter.
3. Configure the canvas with the WebGPU context.
4. Create a main loop to update the engine state and schedule frames.

## Implementation Steps

- Use navigator.gpu.requestAdapter() to get the adapter.
- Use adapter.requestDevice() to obtain the GPU device.
- Initialize the canvas element with GPU configuration.
- Setup error handling and fallback if WebGPU is unsupported.
- Define a loop (using requestAnimationFrame) that updates the engine and triggers rendering.

## Considerations

- Modularize initialization logic in an Engine class.
- Keep error handling isolated and informative.
- Document each API call with inline comments.
- Maintain separation between initialization and rendering logic.

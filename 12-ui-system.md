# 12. UI System

This document details the approach for the UI System module.

## Overview

The UI System handles the rendering and management of 2D user interface elements that appear on top of the 3D scene, including text, buttons, and other interactive elements.

## Approach

1. Create a UIManager class to handle UI rendering and events.
2. Implement basic UI elements (containers, text, buttons, images).
3. Design a layout system for organizing UI components.
4. Add event handling for UI interactions.

## Implementation Steps

- Create a separate rendering pass for UI elements.
- Implement text rendering using WebGPU or canvas-based approaches.
- Design a flexible layout system (grid, stack, absolute positioning).
- Add interactive elements with event callbacks.
- Implement UI styling and theming capabilities.

## Considerations

- Optimize UI rendering for performance.
- Ensure UI scales properly for different screen sizes and resolutions.
- Consider accessibility features such as text scaling and screen readers.
- Design with animation and transition capabilities in mind.
- Plan for localization and text rendering in different languages.
- Implement proper focus management for keyboard navigation.
